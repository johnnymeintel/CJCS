# 01_docs — Documentation and Analysis

This directory contains all formal documentation that defines the CJCS Security Operations Lab.  
Each subfolder represents a major phase of the cybersecurity transformation — from initial posture assessments to rule documentation and investigation writeups.

### Structure
- **Baseline-Assessments/** — System-by-system security posture evaluations (DC01, APP01, MGR1, SIEM01).  
  Each includes findings, configuration results, and remediation notes.
- **Detection-Rules/** — Documentation explaining the logic and MITRE ATT&CK mapping of each custom rule.
- **Investigations/** — Case studies demonstrating end-to-end detection, triage, and analysis using Wazuh telemetry.

### Purpose
This folder serves as the **analyst’s reference library** — combining technical evidence with written context that mirrors how a real SOC would document detections and incidents.
