# 06_evidence — Validation Artifacts and Proof

Contains all supporting evidence that demonstrates successful detections, investigations, and system integrity.

### Structure
- **sample-alerts/** — Raw JSON alert exports from Wazuh for correlation validation.  
- **screenshots/** — Visual evidence from Wazuh Dashboard and command-line tests.  
- **system-states/** — Host-level verification (service status, log samples, configuration snapshots).

### Purpose
This folder functions as the **SOC audit trail** — providing concrete proof that detections work as intended and that all validation steps were performed.
