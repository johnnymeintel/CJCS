**Assessment Date:** 09-25-2025

**Author:** John David Meintel Jr / Security Support Specialist for Cookie Jar Cloud Solutions  

**Assessment Type:** Network connectivity validation and SIEM integration readiness

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Critical Assessment Focus:** Network validation across CJCS infrastructure represents the foundational requirement for successful SIEM deployment and security monitoring operations. 4 VMs running on a single desktop, utilizing both bridged-adapter for domain connectivity and NAT for internet access. 

**Primary Validation Areas:**

- **DNS Resolution Integrity** - Domain name resolution must work bidirectionally across all systems or authentication and service discovery fail.
- **Domain Authentication Channels** - Windows systems require functional secure channels to DC01 for Kerberos ticket validation and group policy enforcement.
- **Time Synchronization Accuracy** - Clock drift beyond 5 minutes breaks Kerberos authentication and makes log correlation worthless for incident investigation.
- **Service Port Accessibility** - Core services must be reachable between systems for application functionality and monitoring agent communication.
- **Network Routing Validation** - Layer 3 connectivity verification prevents silent failures during SIEM agent deployment.

**Compliance Impact:** Network connectivity failures directly impact SOC 2 control implementation around system monitoring (CC7.1) and access controls (CC6.2). Broken connectivity makes compliance monitoring impossible and audit evidence collection unreliable.

**Business Risk:** Network connectivity issues discovered after SIEM deployment result in blind spots, failed log collection, and inability to detect or respond to security incidents effectively.

## 2. Scope & Methodology

**Assessment Scope:** Four-system validation covering domain controller services, web application connectivity, executive workstation management access, and SIEM platform integration points.

**Assessment Methodology:** Command-line validation using native Windows PowerShell and Linux utilities to verify network layer functionality, DNS resolution, domain authentication, and service accessibility without introducing additional tools or dependencies.

**Critical Success Criteria:**

- All systems resolve each other by FQDN and short name
- Domain-joined systems maintain secure channel connectivity to DC01
- Time synchronization within acceptable Kerberos tolerance (5 minutes)
- Core application ports accessible for business functionality
- SIEM agent communication ports ready for deployment

## 3. Network Infrastructure Validation

### 3.1 Domain Controller Connectivity (DC01)

**Purpose:** Validate that DC01 can reach all domain systems and verify that critical AD services are accessible from other infrastructure components.

```powershell
# Basic network validation
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName app01.cjcs.local -Port 80
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName app01.cjcs.local -Port 5432
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName win11-mgr1.cjcs.local -Port 3389
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName siem01.cjcs.local -Port 22

# DNS resolution validation
nslookup app01.cjcs.local
nslookup win11-mgr1.cjcs.local  
nslookup siem01.cjcs.local
nslookup siem01  # short name resolution

# Domain authentication validation - verify trust relationships
nltest /sc_query:cjcs.local

# Active Directory replication health
repadmin /showrepl
dcdiag /test:dns /v

# Network services exposure validation
netstat -an | findstr ":53\|:88\|:389\|:636\|:3268"
```

**Analysis:** DC01 connectivity assessment shows infrastructure foundation operational with expected DNS forwarder warnings that indicate proper network isolation.

**Key Findings:**

- DNS resolution status: [WORKING]
- Domain authentication channels: [VERIFIED]
- Network service accessibility: [ACCESSIBLE]
- Time synchronization drift: [WITHIN TOLERANCE]

### 3.2 Application Server Connectivity (APP01)

**Purpose:** Verify APP01 can communicate with domain services for authentication and SIEM platform for log forwarding, while remaining accessible for management and application traffic.

```powershell
# Verify connectivity to DC for authentication
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName dc01.cjcs.local -Port 88
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName dc01.cjcs.local -Port 389
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName dc01.cjcs.local -Port 53

# Check connectivity to SIEM for log forwarding
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName siem01.cjcs.local -Port 1514
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName siem01.cjcs.local -Port 1515

# Verify management connectivity from MGR1
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName win11-mgr1.cjcs.local -Port 3389 -InformationLevel Quiet

# Database and web service availability validation
netstat -an | findstr ":80\|:443\|:5432"
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*iis*" -or $_.Name -like "*postgresql*"}

# Domain trust validation
Test-ComputerSecureChannel -Server DC01
nltest /sc_query:cjcs.local

# DNS resolution check
nslookup dc01.cjcs.local
nslookup win11-mgr1.cjcs.local
nslookup siem01.cjcs.local
```

**Analysis:** APP01 shows solid connectivity to critical infrastructure but DNS resolution timeouts indicate potential DNS client configuration issues that won't affect functionality but suggest suboptimal DNS server responsiveness.

**Key Findings:**

- Domain controller connectivity: [VERIFIED]
- SIEM communication readiness: [READY]
- Application port accessibility: [ACCESSIBLE]
- Management connectivity: [VERIFIED]

### 3.3 Executive Workstation Connectivity (WIN11-MGR1)

**Purpose:** Validate management access to all infrastructure systems and verify executive workstation can access business applications and monitoring dashboards.

```powershell
# Domain authentication connectivity - Kerberos ticket validation
Test-NetConnection dc01.cjcs.local -Port 88 -InformationLevel Quiet

# Business application access - InventoryFlow Pro web interface
Test-NetConnection app01.cjcs.local -Port 80 -InformationLevel Quiet

# Security monitoring access - SIEM management interface
Test-NetConnection siem01.cjcs.local -Port 22 -InformationLevel Quiet

# Domain trust relationship validation - verify workstation can authenticate to domain
Test-ComputerSecureChannel -Server DC01

# User context verification - confirm executive domain authentication
whoami /fqdn

# DNS resolution validation - verify name resolution for critical infrastructure
nslookup dc01.cjcs.local
nslookup app01.cjcs.local
nslookup siem01.cjcs.local
```

**Analysis:** MGR1 executive workstation shows complete operational connectivity with DNS timeout warnings that don't affect functionality - typical of Windows systems querying DNS servers under load.

**Key Findings:**

- Management protocol accessibility: [VERIFIED]
- Application connectivity: [WORKING]
- SIEM dashboard access: [ACCESSIBLE]
- Domain authentication status: [VERIFIED]
