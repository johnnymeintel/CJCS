## 1. Executive Summary

**Critical Risk Assessment:** Given the limited scope of the homelab environment which represents CJCS infrastructure, DC01 serves as the backbone for the entire company. If compromised, an attacker could gain access to the entire network within minutes, and potentially remain undetected. 

**Primary Risk Vectors:**

- **Privileged Account Exposure** - Domain Admins group membership creates high-value credential targets for attackers.
- **Kerberos Authentication Vulnerabilities** - Potential for Golden Ticket attacks through krbtgt account compromise if an attacker were to gain domain admin privileges. 
- **DNS Poisoning Opportunities** - DNS service integration creates unnecessary additional attack surface.
- **Lateral Movement Facilitation** - Domain controller access enables immediate spread to all domain-joined systems.
- **Authentication Event Monitoring Gaps** - Insufficient logging of critical privileged account activities and authentication failures due to typical default Windows logging which is not suitable for forensics (doesn't capture logon types, source workstations, or authentication failures).

**Compliance Impact:** SOC 2 Type II control failures around access controls (CC6.2), audit logging (CC7.2), and privileged account management (CC6.3). Current DC configuration lacks comprehensive monitoring of authentication events required for access control audit requirements.

**Business Risk:** DC01 compromise enables immediate deployment of ransomware across all company systems with potential for complete business operations shutdown and severe regulatory violations.

## 3. System Identification

```powershell
Get-ComputerInfo | Select-Object WindowsProductName,OsBuildNumber,WindowsVersion,CsProcessors,CsDomain # Gets and displays key computer and operating system information
```

- Operating System: Windows Server 2022 Standard Evaluation
- CsProcessors: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-11400F @ 2.60GHz
- CsDomain: cjcs.local

```powershell
Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object TotalVisibleMemorySize,FreePhysicalMemory,CSName # Retrieves and displays total and available RAM, along with the computer's name, from the operating system.
```

- TotalVisibleMemorySize: 4193844 KB
- FreePhysicalMemory: 3137400 KB
- Free Physical Memory Percentage: 74.81%

```powershell
Get-CimInstance Win32_LogicalDisk -Filter "DriveType=3" | Select-Object DeviceID,Size,FreeSpace # Displays local hard drive information, including device ID, total size, and free space.
```

- FreeSpace: 56568381440 (87.81%)

---

## 4. Active Directory Core Health

```powershell
Get-ADForest | Select-Object Name,ForestMode,DomainNamingMaster,SchemaMaster # Gets AD forest info and FSMO roles - critical for domain trust monitoring
Get-ADDomain | Select-Object Name,DomainMode,PDCEmulator,RIDMaster,InfrastructureMaster # Gets AD domain info and remaining FSMO roles - essential for AD health baseline
Get-Service ADWS,DNS,KDC,Netlogon,NTDS | Select-Object Name,Status,StartType # Checks critical AD service status - key indicators for domain controller health
repadmin /showrepl # Shows AD replication partners and status - identifies replication issues affecting security updates
repadmin /replsummary # Displays AD replication summary across all DCs - quick health check for domain sync
gpresult /r /scope computer # Shows applied computer group policies - validates security policy enforcement
```

- **Forest/domain mode**: **Windows2016Forest** and **Windows 2008 or later domain mode** confirm modern AD schema with current Kerberos encryption and password policy options; this supports SOC 2 CC6.x compliance and resists downgrade attacks.
- **FSMO roles**: All critical operations masters (**DomainNamingMaster, SchemaMaster, PDCEmulator, RIDMaster, InfrastructureMaster**) reside on **DC01**, simplifying management but creating a **single point of failure** for schema changes, RID allocation, and time synchronization.
- **Critical services**: **ADWS, DNS, KDC, Netlogon, NTDS** all installed and running, indicating a healthy domain controller baseline with no missing core services that could allow silent replication or authentication failures.
- **Replication**: `repadmin /showrepl` and `/replsummary` report no partners and no failures, consistent with a **single-DC forest**; while normal for a small lab, it means **zero redundancy** and a failed DC01 would halt all authentication.
- **Group Policy**: `gpresult` shows only the **Default Domain Controllers Policy** and **Default Domain Policy** applied successfully, confirming baseline security policy enforcement but highlighting a lack of **custom hardening GPOs** (e.g., stricter audit, password, or firewall settings).
- **Business risk**: Any compromise or outage of DC01 immediately disrupts **CJCS authentication, DNS, and policy enforcement**, enabling domain-wide lateral movement and non-compliance with SOC 2 access control and audit requirements.

---

## 5. DNS Configuration

```powershell
Get-DnsServerForwarder # Gets DNS forwarder config - monitors for unauthorized DNS redirects and potential data exfiltration
Get-DnsServerZone | Select-Object ZoneName,ZoneType,IsDsIntegrated,IsAutoCreated # Lists DNS zones and integration status - baseline for detecting rogue zones
Get-DnsServerResourceRecord -ZoneName "cjcs.local" # Gets DNS records for specific zone - establishes baseline for DNS hijacking detection
```

- **DNS forwarders**: Configured to **Google 8.8.8.8** and **Cloudflare 1.1.1.1** with root hints enabled; confirms external resolution is intentional and fast but requires **continuous monitoring** to prevent malicious forwarder changes that could redirect CJCS traffic.
- **Zones**: Only expected zones present‚Äî**cjcs.local** and **msdcs.cjcs.local** as Active Directory‚Äìintegrated primaries, plus default reverse zones; no rogue or secondary zones detected, supporting **integrity of internal name resolution**.
- **Resource records**: Contain standard A, AAAA, NS, SOA, and SRV entries for core services (Kerberos, LDAP, GC, kpasswd) and known hosts (**APP01, WIN11-MGR1, DC01**); timestamps and TTLs align with normal updates, showing **healthy dynamic DNS** with no suspicious additions.
- **Security posture**: Centralizing DNS on DC01 reduces complexity but creates a **single point of compromise**; if DC01 is breached, attackers could poison records to reroute traffic or harvest credentials.
- **Business impact**: A DNS misconfiguration or compromise could cause **company-wide authentication failures or silent traffic interception**, breaking SOC 2 CC6.2 and CC7.2 requirements for secure, auditable name resolution.

---

## 6. Account & Security Baseline

```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter * | Select-Object Name,SamAccountName,Enabled,PasswordNeverExpires,LastLogonDate # Gets all AD users with key security attributes - baseline for dormant accounts and weak password policies
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" # Lists Domain Admin members - critical for privileged access monitoring and unauthorized elevation detection
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Enterprise Admins" # Lists Enterprise Admin members - monitors highest privilege level for potential compromise indicators
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Schema Admins" # Lists Schema Admin members - tracks changes to AD schema permissions and potential persistence mechanisms
```

- **Domain Admin membership**: **Administrator, mchen, jwong, drodriguez** are all present, creating **four high-privilege accounts** in a small environment. This expands the potential blast radius if any credential is compromised.
- **Enterprise/Schema Admins**: No unexpected members discovered, which fits a **single-domain forest** and limits schema-level change risk.
- **User inventory**: Standard built-ins plus named users and the service account **psql_svc**. Most show **no LastLogonDate**, signaling **limited or first-time use**, typical for a freshly built lab but still part of the baseline to track.
- **Account states**: **Guest** is disabled and **krbtgt** is disabled as expected; other active accounts are enabled and have normal expiration behavior, providing a **clean starting point for access review**.
- **Baseline implication**: DC01 currently holds **all privileged control on a single host** with no secondary DC, so compromise of any of these accounts would immediately affect **authentication, directory integrity, and SOC 2 access-control evidence** for CJCS.

---

## 7. Authentication & Kerberos

```powershell
Get-ADUser krbtgt -Property * | Select-Object Enabled,PasswordLastSet # Gets krbtgt account status and password age - critical for Golden Ticket attack detectio
klist # Lists current Kerberos tickets - identifies suspicious ticket usage and potential Pass-the-Ticket attacks
```

- **krbtgt status**: **Disabled** as expected; **PasswordLastSet 2025-09-05** establishes current Kerberos key material and baseline age for ticket-signing integrity.
- **Ticket cache scope**: Two tickets for **CJCSAdmin**‚Äîa **TGT (krbtgt/CJCS.LOCAL)** and a **service ticket (host/dc01.cjcs.local)**‚Äîconfirm normal DC01-issued Kerberos workflow.
- **Crypto & flags**: Both tickets use **AES-256**; flags show **forwardable** and **renewable** (TGT also **initial**), with **ok_as_delegate** on the host/DC ticket‚Äîconsistent with domain controller trust for delegation.
- **Lifetimes**: **10-hour** ticket validity with **7-day** renew window aligns with standard Kerberos policy, indicating predictable authentication cadence for log correlation.
- **Business relevance**: Evidence that **Kerberos is operational and using strong encryption** under DC01, providing reliable authentication semantics CJCS depends on for domain access and audit trails.

## 8. Network Services & Attack Surface

```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -State Listen | Select-Object LocalAddress,LocalPort,OwningProcess | Sort-Object LocalPort # Gets listening TCP ports - baseline for detecting rogue services and backdoors
$procByPid = Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | Group-Object -Property ProcessId -AsHashTable -AsString # Creates process lookup table by PID for correlation analysis
Get-NetTCPConnection -State Listen | Sort-Object LocalPort | ForEach-Object { # Maps listening ports to processes and executables - critical for malware detection and unauthorized service identification
    $p = $procByPid[[string]$_.OwningProcess]
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        LocalAddress = $_.LocalAddress
        LocalPort = $_.LocalPort
        PID = $_.OwningProcess
        ProcessName = $p.Name
        ExecutablePath = $p.ExecutablePath
    }
}
```

- **Role exposure**: DC01 is advertising full **AD/DC services** on both stacks and both NICs (**192.168.100.10** bridged, **10.0.3.15** NAT), expanding the network surface of **authentication, directory, and file** functions.
- **DNS (53/TCP,UDP)**: **dns.exe** bound on loopback, link-local, NAT, and LAN; indicates DC01 is the **authoritative resolver** for cjcs.local and upstream client traffic.
- **Kerberos (88/TCP,UDP; 464/TCP,UDP)**: **lsass.exe** listening globally; confirms DC01 as the **KDC** and password-change endpoint, central to ticket issuance and trust.
- **LDAP/LDAPS (389/636)**: Directory over **LDAP** and **LDAP over TLS** exposed on all addresses; baseline shows **directory query** and **secure directory** channels available to clients.
- **Global Catalog (3268/3269)**: GC and GC over TLS active; DC01 is a **Global Catalog** (matches IS_GC), enabling forest-wide lookups used by logon and apps.
- **SMB/NetLogon (445/139)**: **System** is listening for **file, SYSVOL, and NetLogon**; required for policy/script distribution and domain operations.
- **RPC core (135, 593)**: **Endpoint Mapper** and **RPC over HTTP** present; foundational for many AD/DC remote procedures and management flows.
- **WinRM (5985)**: Remote management channel is listening (**::** scope shown); provides **WS-Man** control surface used by administration and automation.
- **AD Web Services (9389)**: **ADWS** reachable on v4/v6; supports **PowerShell/RSAT** and programmatic directory access.
- **Dynamic RPC ports (49664‚Äì49669, 54875/78/87/96, etc.)**: Ephemeral listeners reflect **MSRPC allocation**, typical for DC workloads and remote calls.
- **IPv6 enabled**: Multiple **AAAA/listeners** (e.g., **::**, link-local) indicate dual-stack operation; name resolution and access occur over **IPv4 and IPv6**.
- **Business relevance**: With all **core AD, DNS, GC, SMB, RPC, and management** services open on **all interfaces**, DC01 is the **single operational hinge** for CJCS identity and policy; any service disruption or misuse directly impacts **logon, name resolution, and access** across the company.

---

## 9. Firewall & SMB Configuration

```powershell
Get-NetFirewallProfile # Gets Windows firewall profile settings - baseline for firewall policy enforcement and security posture assessment
Get-NetFirewallRule -PolicyStore ActiveStore | Select-Object Name,DisplayName,Direction,Action,Enabled,Profile # Lists active firewall rules - detects unauthorized rule changes and security policy violations
Get-SmbServerConfiguration | Select-Object EnableSMB1Protocol,EnableSMB2Protocol,RequireSecuritySignature # Gets SMB config including vulnerable SMBv1 status - critical for lateral movement prevention
```

- **Firewall profiles**: **Domain, Private, Public = Enabled**; default actions show **NotConfigured**, implying behavior is driven by existing rule set rather than explicit block/allow defaults.
- **Firewall logging**: Path **pfirewall.log**, size **4096 KB**; **LogAllowed = False**, **LogBlocked = False**. Baseline indicates **minimal firewall telemetry** from DC01.
- **Directory services rules**: Numerous **ADDS** inbound allows (**LDAP/LDAPS, GC/GC-SSL, Kerberos, Kpasswd, RPC, NTP**) are active for **Any** profile, reflecting DC01‚Äôs role as the **identity and directory hub**.
- **DNS rules**: **DNS TCP/UDP In** and **RPC/Endpoint Mapper** allows are present; baseline confirms DC01 as the **authoritative resolver** and management endpoint for DNS.
- **SMB rules**: **FPS-SMB-In/Out** and related **NB-Name/Datagram/Session** rules are **Enabled** across **Domain, Private, Public**; baseline shows broad **file/NETLOGON/SYSVOL reachability**.
- **Remote management**: **WINRM-HTTP-In** is **Enabled** for **Domain, Private**, and a separate **WINRM-HTTP-In-TCP-PUBLIC = Enabled**; **WMI-In/Out** also enabled for all profiles. Baseline shows **multiple management channels** exposed.
- **Service discovery and multicast**: **LLMNR** and **mDNS** inbound/outbound rules enabled on several profiles; **ICMPv6**, **Router Advertisements/Solicitations**, **Neighbor Discovery**, and **IGMP** rules are active, indicating **dual-stack and multicast** participation.
- **Tunneling/edge networking**: **Teredo** and **IPHTTPS** rules are enabled (**In/Out**), establishing baseline support for **IPv6 transition mechanisms**.
- **Delivery Optimization**: **TCP-In** and **UDP-In** entries **Enabled**; baseline includes content distribution services on DC01.
- **SMB stack configuration**: **EnableSMB1Protocol = False**, **EnableSMB2Protocol = True**, **RequireSecuritySignature = True**; baseline indicates **modern SMB** with **session signing** enforced.
- **Business relevance**: The active rule set exposes **directory, DNS, SMB, and remote management** across profiles, and with **firewall logging disabled**, DC01‚Äôs **reachability** is broad while **on-box firewall telemetry** is limited.

---

## 10. Time Synchronization

```powershell
w32tm /query /status # Gets Windows time sync status - critical for accurate log timestamps and Kerberos authentication
w32tm /query /configuration # Gets time service configuration - ensures proper time sync for log correlation and forensic analysis
```

- **Time source**: **Local CMOS Clock (LOCL)** with **Stratum 1** and **Leap 0**; last successful sync **2025-09-25 08:14:32**. Establishes DC01 as an **authoritative clock** in the domain.
- **Domain role**: **NtpServer = Enabled**, **NtpClient = Enabled**, **Type = NT5DS**; DC01 is advertising time within the **AD hierarchy**, consistent with a PDC-style authority for Kerberos and replication.
- **Polling/discipline**: **Poll Interval = 64s**, **SpecialPollInterval = 1024s**, **Min/MaxPoll = 6/10**; clock discipline parameters indicate **regular, short-interval corrections** suitable for directory and ticket timing.
- **Phase limits**: **MaxPos/NegPhaseCorrection = 172800s**, **MaxAllowedPhaseOffset = 300s**; baseline bounds for **time adjustments** and acceptable **skew** in authentication and logging.
- **Providers**: **VMICTimeProvider = Enabled** (hypervisor integration), **NtpClient InputProvider = 1**, **NtpServer InputProvider = 0**; confirms **virtualized host influence** plus **domain time advertisement**.
- **Business relevance**: Kerberos, AD replication, and event correlation all **depend on DC01‚Äôs clock**; current configuration defines the **reference timeline** for CJCS authentication and audit semantics.

---

## 11. Event & Audit Logs

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4625} -MaxEvents 50 | Select TimeCreated,Id,Message # Gets failed logon events - essential for brute force attack and credential stuffing detection
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Directory Service" -MaxEvents 50 # Gets AD service events - monitors domain controller activities and potential AD compromise indicators
Get-WinEvent -LogName "DNS Server" -MaxEvents 50 # Gets DNS server events - detects DNS tunneling, suspicious queries, and potential data exfiltration attempts
```

- **Failed logons (4625)**: Recent failures clustered on **2025-09-24 ~09:55** with earlier isolated attempts on **2025-09-13** and **2025-09-07**; establishes a **baseline rate of authentication failures** for DC01.
- **Directory Service startup/maintenance**: Burst of events on **2025-09-25 ~08:13‚Äì08:29** and **2025-09-24 ~23:24** showing **service start/shutdown (1004)**, **online defragmentation (3027, 3033, 700, 701)**, and **database engine notices (330, 326, 105, 102)**; pattern indicates **regular service cycling and maintenance** after boots.
- **Directory Service security advisories**: Repeated **3041, 2886** and related messages during startup; records the **server‚Äôs stated security configuration** at boot for audit correlation.
- **Directory Service readiness**: **1869** and related entries mark **operational availability** post-startup; forms the **time anchor** for replication and policy application on DC01.
- **DNS Server lifecycle**: Cyclic **service start (2)**, **background load complete (4)**, **zone load for cjcs.local and _msdcs (769)**, and **shutdown (3)** across **2025-09-19 ‚Üí 2025-09-25**; establishes **normal zone initialization** after restarts.
- **DNS AD dependency**: Recurrent **4013** during boot shows DNS **waiting for Active Directory**; normal ordering in a single-DC environment.
- **DNS configuration changes**: **7693** logged on multiple dates; records **scope/option value set** events, providing a **change timeline** for DNS behavior.
- **DNS anomalous input**: **5504** on **2025-09-21** notes **invalid domain name** queries received; documents **non-standard DNS traffic** observed at the server.
- **Business relevance**: Logs demonstrate **operational identity services** with periodic restarts, a **measured background level of failed logons**, and **predictable DNS zone loads**; together they define the **baseline timing and noise floor** for CJCS authentication and name-resolution monitoring.

---

## 12. Patching & Hotfixes

```powershell
Get-HotFix | Sort-Object InstalledOn -Descending # Gets installed Windows updates sorted by date - baseline for patch management and vulnerability assessment
```

- **Patch inventory**: Three recent entries ‚Äî **KB5010523**, **KB5011497**, **KB5008882** ‚Äî sorted by **InstalledOn (descending)**.
- **Update types**: Mix of **Security Update** and general **Update**, indicating both security and quality channels are represented in the baseline.
- **InstalledOn**: Dates shown as truncated (**‚Äú3‚Ä¶‚Äù** in excerpt); establishes the latest visible patch window without full chronology.
- **InstalledBy**: Not present in the excerpt; installer attribution is **unspecified** in this view.
- **Baseline implication**: Provides a **minimum patch floor** for DC01 and a **time anchor** for vulnerability exposure and event-correlation across CJCS systems.

## 14. Detection & SOC Integration

### **SIEM Rule Priorities:**

**Critical Priority (P1) - Domain Controller Authentication Events:**

- Event ID 4768 - Kerberos TGT requests with unusual encryption downgrades (RC4 vs AES-256)
- Event ID 4769 - Kerberos service ticket requests to sensitive services (LDAP, DNS, file shares)
- Event ID 4624/4625 - Interactive logons to DC01 (should be extremely rare for non-admin accounts)
- Event ID 4648 - Explicit credential use (potential pass-the-hash detection)

**High Priority (P2) - Privileged Account Monitoring:**

- Event ID 4672 - Special privileges assigned to new logon (Domain Admin activity)
- Event ID 4720/4726 - Domain user account creation/deletion
- Event ID 4728/4729 - Domain Admin group membership changes
- Event ID 5136 - Directory service object modifications (especially privileged groups)

**Medium Priority (P3) - Infrastructure Health & Attack Indicators:**

- Event ID 4103 - PowerShell module logging (potential attack tooling)
- DNS Server Event ID 770 - DNS zone transfer requests from unauthorized sources
- Event ID 1220 - LDAP over SSL failures (potential downgrade attacks)
- System Event ID 1074 - Unexpected system shutdowns

### **Alerting Thresholds and Escalation Criteria:**

**Immediate Escalation (5 minutes):**

- Any interactive logon to DC01 outside business hours
- Multiple failed authentication attempts (>10) for Domain Admin accounts within 15 minutes
- Kerberos Golden/Silver ticket indicators (unusual ticket lifetimes, encryption downgrades)
- DNS zone transfer requests from external IP addresses

**High Priority Alerts (15 minutes):**

- Domain Admin group membership changes
- New privileged account creation
- PowerShell execution on DC01 (should trigger investigation)
- Time synchronization failures affecting Kerberos authentication

**Monitoring Baselines:**

- Normal Domain Admin logon pattern: Business hours only, specific workstations
- Expected authentication volume: <100 Kerberos requests per hour during off-hours
- DNS query baseline: Monitor for suspicious domain lookups or high-volume queries

---

## **15. Compliance Impact**

### **SOC 2 Control Failures:**

**CC6.1 (Logical Access Controls) - CRITICAL FAILURE:**

- Excessive Domain Admin membership (4 accounts) violates least privilege principle
- Unencrypted LDAP communications expose credentials during authentication
- Evidence: Get-ADGroupMember output, Event ID 1220 SSL unavailable warnings

**CC6.7 (Access Review) - MODERATE FAILURE:**

- No evidence of regular privileged account review process
- Domain Admin accounts show no recent access validation
- Evidence: No documented access review procedures in assessment data

**CC7.1 (System Monitoring) - MODERATE FAILURE:**

- Firewall logging disabled prevents security event correlation
- Limited authentication failure tracking capabilities
- Evidence: Get-NetFirewallProfile shows LogAllowed: False, LogBlocked: False

**CC8.1 (Vulnerability Management) - CRITICAL FAILURE:**

- 3+ year patch gap represents systematic vulnerability management failure
- Evidence: Get-HotFix shows last updates from 3/3/2022

### **Recommended Control Implementation:**

**Immediate (30 days):**

- Enable LDAPS encryption for all AD communications (CC6.1)
- Implement emergency patching process for critical security updates (CC8.1)
- Enable comprehensive firewall and authentication logging (CC7.1)

**Short-term (90 days):**

- Deploy tiered administration model with separate privileged accounts (CC6.1)
- Implement quarterly privileged account access reviews (CC6.7)
- Deploy automated patch management solution (CC8.1)
