### 🏷 SIEM01 - Security Information & Event Management - Baseline Security Assessment – Cookie Jar Cloud Solutions

**Target Host:** [siem01.cjcs.local 192.168.100.5/24] 

**Assessment Date:** 09/23/2025

**Author:** John David Meintel Jr / Security Analyst for Cookie Jar Cloud Solutions 

**System Role:** Log aggregation, data analysis for event management


---

## **1. Executive Summary**

**Critical Risk Assessment:** SIEM01 successfully provides log collection and monitoring for CJCS infrastructure, but time synchronization issues could compromise incident investigation accuracy. The system works for basic threat detection but needs immediate fixes before production use.

**Primary Risk Vectors:** 

• **Timeline Problems** - Clock sync issues make it harder to investigate security incidents accurately 

• **Self-Monitoring Gaps** - The security monitoring system doesn't monitor its own security health 

• **Extra Software Risk** - Development tools installed that aren't needed increase attack opportunities 

• **Audit Readiness** - Current setup has gaps that could fail SOC 2 compliance requirements

**Compliance Impact:** Three SOC 2 control gaps found that need fixing before customer audits. Time sync and system monitoring are basic requirements that auditors expect to see working properly.

**Business Risk:** SIEM platform gives CJCS the security monitoring foundation it needs, but configuration issues must be fixed immediately to support customer trust and pass compliance audits.

---

## **2. Scope & Methodology**

**System Type:** Ubuntu Linux server running Wazuh security monitoring platform in controlled lab environment

**Assessment Approach:** Standard security assessment using Linux command-line tools, focused on SIEM-specific security requirements and compliance readiness rather than general server setup

**Focus Areas:** 

• **SIEM Security** - Protecting the monitoring system itself from compromise 

• **System Health** - Ensuring reliable log collection and analysis capabilities

• **Compliance Prep** - Meeting SOC 2 requirements for security monitoring controls 

• **Production Readiness** - Identifying what needs fixing before real-world deployment

**Evidence Location:** 21 security assessment scripts with detailed results, providing clear documentation for remediation and future compliance audits

## 4. Package Management & Patch Status

```bash
apt list --upgradable 2>/dev/null | grep -i security    # available security updates
grep " install " /var/log/dpkg.log | tail -20           # recently installed packages
cat /etc/apt/sources.list                               # package sources (main repository list)
ls -la /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ 2>/dev/null             # extra source files (PPA or vendor repos)
grep -E "(Allowed-Origins|Automatic-Reboot)" /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/*unattended* 2>/dev/null  # auto update / unattended-upgrade policy
```

- 2025-09-19 Wazuh core deployed:

## 5. User Accounts & Authentication

```bash
getent passwd | egrep ':(/bin/bash|/bin/sh)$'                          # human login-capable accounts
for g in sudo admin wheel root docker; do getent group $g >/dev/null && echo "$g: $(getent group $g | cut -d: -f4)"; done   # membership in privileged group
egrep 'PASS_MAX_DAYS|PASS_MIN_DAYS|PASS_WARN_AGE' /etc/login.defs      # system-wide password policy
lastlog | head -20                                                     # recent successful logins
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log 2>/dev/null | tail -15        # recent failed login attempts
```

- Human login accounts: root and jmeintel (primary administrator).
- Privilege: jmeintel is the only member of the sudo group; root is present but shows **Never logged in**.
- Password policy: PASS_MAX_DAYS 99999 (no forced expiry), PASS_MIN_DAYS 0 (immediate change allowed), PASS_WARN_AGE 7 (one-week warning).
- All other system service accounts (daemon, bin, www-data, etc.) show **Never logged in**, indicating no interactive shells.

---

## 6. SSH Security Configuration

```bash
systemctl is-active sshd                                                          # check if SSH service is running
systemctl is-enabled sshd                                                         # check if SSH service is enabled at boot
egrep '^(PermitRootLogin|PasswordAuthentication|PermitEmptyPasswords|PubkeyAuthentication|Port|Protocol)' /etc/ssh/sshd_config | egrep -v '^#'   # critical SSH settings (root login, password login, keys, port, protocol)
ls -la /root/.ssh/ 2>/dev/null                                                    # inspect root's SSH key directory
ls -la /home/*/.ssh/ 2>/dev/null                                                  # inspect user SSH key directories
who                                                                               # list currently logged-in users
w                                                                                 # show current sessions with detailed activity
```

- SSH service is **inactive and not enabled at boot**, meaning no remote shell access is available.
- The only `.ssh` directory belongs to user **jmeintel**, containing an empty `authorized_keys` file.
- Current login is a **single local console session** by jmeintel on `tty1`.
- System uptime is 58 minutes with negligible load (0.00).

## 7. Network Services & Exposure

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running --no-pager | grep -v systemd    # running non-systemd services
ss -tulpn 2>/dev/null || netstat -tulpn 2>/dev/null                                  # active listening sockets and owning processes
ip addr show                                                                         # network interface addresses
ip route show                                                                        # current routing table
cat /etc/resolv.conf                                                                 # primary DNS configuration
systemd-resolve --status 2>/dev/null | grep -A5 "DNS Servers"                        # detailed DNS server status from systemd-resolved
```

- Active services include only core OS daemons plus **Wazuh manager, indexer, and dashboard**, along with **Filebeat** for log shipping and **vboxadd-service** for VirtualBox integration.
- Networking shows **two interfaces**:
    - enp0s3 (192.168.100.5/24) for the CJCS internal LAN
    - enp0s8 (10.0.3.15/24) NAT for Internet access
- Default route and DNS queries are directed through enp0s8 with Google public DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) and a local stub resolver at 127.0.0.53.
- Listening sockets include Wazuh service ports **1514/1515 and 55000**, the Wazuh dashboard on **443**, and the indexer on **9200 and 9300**, all bound to 0.0.0.0.
- No unexpected third-party services are running.

## 8. Firewall & Network Hardening

```bash
ufw status verbose 2>/dev/null || echo "UFW not installed/configured"   # check UFW firewall status and rules
iptables -L -n                                                          # list current iptables firewall chains and rules
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward                                              # verify IPv4 packet forwarding (should be 0 for a host)
sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects                                 # check if ICMP redirect sending is allowed
sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects                               # check if host accepts ICMP redirects
sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route                             # check if host accepts source-routed packets
```

- **UFW firewall is inactive** and the default iptables chains (INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT) all have **ACCEPT** policy with no explicit rules, meaning packet filtering is not enforced.
- Kernel network settings show:
    - `net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0` — packet forwarding disabled, appropriate for a host that is not routing traffic.
    - `net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 1` and `accept_redirects = 1` — ICMP redirects are allowed, which can permit route manipulation.
    - `net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0` — source-routed packets are blocked, which is correct for security.

---

## 9. Filesystem Security

```bash
mount | egrep 'noexec|nosuid|nodev'                                             # check secure mount options on critical filesystems
find /usr/bin /usr/sbin /bin /sbin -perm /6000 -type f 2>/dev/null | head -20   # list first 20 SUID/SGID binaries (privilege escalation risk)
find /etc /usr /var -type f -perm -0002 2>/dev/null | head -20                  # list first 20 world-writable files in key directories
ls -ld /etc /var/log /home /root /tmp                                           # verify permissions on critical directories
```

- Secure mounts: core pseudo-filesystems (`/sys`, `/proc`, `/run`, `/dev`, `/sys/fs/*`, etc.) are mounted with `nosuid,nodev,noexec`. This is the expected baseline hardening for kernel and runtime pseudo-filesystems.
- Shared folder: `/media/sf_CJCS` (vboxsf) is mounted `rw,nodev` only; it lacks `nosuid` and `noexec`. This leaves room for accidental execution or privilege artefacts from the host.
- SUID/SGID binaries (sample): `/usr/bin/su`, `/usr/bin/sudo`, `/usr/bin/passwd`, `/usr/bin/crontab`, `/usr/bin/mount`, `/usr/bin/umount`, `/usr/bin/chsh`, `/usr/bin/newgrp`, `/usr/bin/fusermount3`, `/usr/sbin/unix_chkpwd`. These are standard on a managed Linux host but represent escalation-capable code paths and should be audited for necessity and patch status.
- Directory permissions:
    - `/etc` owned root:root mode 755 — standard.
    - `/home` owned root:root mode 755 — user homes present.
    - `/root` owned root:root mode 700 — good (root directory not world-readable).
    - `/tmp` mode `drwxrwxrwt` (sticky, world-writable) — expected behaviour for `/tmp`.
    - `/var/log` owned root:syslog mode shows group `syslog` with write/read — normal for centralized logging but verify group membership and log rotation policies.

---

## 10. Wazuh Manager Security

```bash
systemctl is-active wazuh-manager || echo "wazuh-manager not installed"   # service state (running/active) or not present
ls -la /var/ossec/ 2>/dev/null | head -20                                 # Wazuh install dir: ownership/permissions (top entries)
ls -la /etc/wazuh-manager/ 2>/dev/null                                     # Wazuh manager config dir: verify perms and presence of config files
ps aux | egrep '(wazuh|ossec)' | grep -v egrep                             # running Wazuh/OSSEC processes and owning users
```

- **Service state**: wazuh-manager active.
- **Processes**: Wazuh dashboard (Node), indexer (Java, ≈1.5 GiB memory), and manager/API workers are running under dedicated `wazuh` service accounts; supporting daemons (authd, syscheckd, logcollector, modulesd) run as root where elevated privileges are required.

---

## 11. Log File Integrity & Rotation

```bash
ls -la /var/log/auth.log /var/log/syslog /var/log/kern.log 2>/dev/null    # check permissions and ownership of key log files
grep -E '^(weekly|daily|rotate|size|compress)' /etc/logrotate.conf 2>/dev/null   # view logrotate frequency, retention, compression settings
egrep '^[^#]' /etc/rsyslog.conf 2>/dev/null | head -20                   # display active rsyslog configuration lines
df -h /var/log                                                            # check free space and usage on /var/log partition

```

- Key logs (`auth.log`, `kern.log`, `syslog`) are **root-owned (syslog:adm)** with **640 permissions**, limiting read access to the `adm` group and preventing unauthorized access.
- Logrotate is set to **weekly rotation, keep 4 archives, compress old logs**, ensuring predictable retention and disk management.
- `rsyslog` is active with default modules and secure file creation settings (0640), dropping privileges to `syslog:syslog`.
- `/var/log` resides on the root LVM volume (58 GB total, 38 GB free), providing ample space for log growth.

---

## 12. System Integrity & Auditing

```bash
which aide && aide --version 2>/dev/null || echo "AIDE not installed"      # check if AIDE file-integrity tool is present and versioned
systemctl is-active auditd                                                 # check if audit daemon is running
auditctl -s 2>/dev/null | head -10                                         # show auditd status and rule summary
debsums -s 2>/dev/null | head -20 || echo "debsums not installed"          # verify package integrity if debsums is available
```

- **AIDE**: Not installed. No file-integrity baseline is in place.
- **auditd**: Inactive. No kernel-level auditing of file changes or security events is occurring.
- **debsums**: Not installed (implied by missing output), so no built-in package checksum verification.

---

## 13. Process & Performance Baseline

```bash
ps auxf | head -30                                   # show top 20 processes in tree form for parent/child relationships
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -15                       # list highest CPU and memory consumers
ss -tulpn | grep LISTEN | head -20                   # display listening processes with network context (ports and PIDs)
```

- **Kernel tasks**: Dozens of low-level `[kworker]`, `migration`, and `rcu` threads shown at the top of `ps auxf`. These are normal Linux housekeeping processes and not security concerns.
- **Wazuh services**: Multiple `wazuh-*` daemons dominate user-space activity, including `wazuh-indexer` (Java/OpenSearch engine ~1.5 GB RAM, ~5 % CPU), `wazuh-dashboard` (Node.js UI), `wazuh-syscheckd`, `wazuh-modulesd`, `wazuh-analysisd`, `wazuh-remoted`, and supporting Python API workers. These match the intended SIEM role and are expected to remain persistent.
- **Listening network ports**:
    - Wazuh manager and agents: TCP 1514, 1515, 55000.
    - Wazuh indexer (OpenSearch): TCP 9200, 9300.
    - Wazuh dashboard: TCP 443.
    - SSH service: TCP 22.
    - Local DNS stub: 127.0.0.53 and 127.0.0.54 on TCP/UDP 53.

---

## 14. Kernel & Module Security

```bash
lsmod | head -20                                              # list first 20 loaded kernel modules
egrep -i 'nx|smep|smap' /proc/cpuinfo | head -5               # check CPU support for NX, SMEP, SMAP protections
cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space                       # verify ASLR (address space layout randomization) setting
cat /proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict                           # check dmesg access restrictions
dmesg | tail -20                                              # show last 20 kernel log messages
```

- **Loaded kernel modules**: First 20 modules are standard (nf_tables, inet_diag, cfg80211, intel_* drivers, sound modules, vboxsf for shared folders). No suspicious third-party modules.
- **CPU security flags**: `nx` present, meaning hardware no-execute protection is active. `smep` and `smap` not listed, which is normal for many VirtualBox guests.
- **ASLR**: `/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space` = `2` → full address space layout randomization is enabled.
- **dmesg restrict**: `/proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict` = `1` → only privileged users can read kernel logs.
- **Recent kernel messages**:
    - vboxsf successfully mounted shared folder `CJCS` at `/media/sf_CJCS`.
    - Several AppArmor “DENIED mknod” events tied to `ubuntu_pro_*` profiles, consistent with Ubuntu live security updates; no evidence of compromise.

---

## 15. Scheduled Tasks

```bash
ls -la /etc/cron.* 2>/dev/null                                                    # list system-wide cron job directories and their contents
crontab -l 2>/dev/null || echo "No root crontab"                                  # check root’s personal crontab for scheduled jobs
for u in $(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd); do crontab -u "$u" -l 2>/dev/null && echo "Crontab for $u found"; done   # enumerate per-user crontabs across system
```

- **System cron directories**: Standard Ubuntu layout.
    - `/etc/cron.daily`: normal maintenance scripts such as `apt-compat`, `logrotate`, `man-db`, `sysstat`.
    - `/etc/cron.d`, `/etc/cron.hourly`, `/etc/cron.weekly`, `/etc/cron.monthly`, `/etc/cron.yearly`: contain default placeholders and a few expected jobs (e.g., `e2scrub_all`, `man-db`, `sysstat`).
- **Root crontab**: None defined.
- **Per-user crontabs**: None found.

---

## 16. Development Tools & Package Managers

```bash
which gcc g++ make python python3 perl ruby 2>/dev/null || true   # check presence of common compilers/interpreters
which apt dpkg snap pip pip3 2>/dev/null || true                 # check presence of package managers and python package tools
```

- **Compilers/interpreters**: gcc, g++, make, python3, perl are installed. No Ruby or legacy python (python2).
- **Package managers**: apt, dpkg, snap are installed; pip and pip3 were not detected.

---

## 17. Container Security (if Docker is added later)

```bash
systemctl is-active docker 2>/dev/null || echo "Docker not installed"   # check if Docker service is running
docker --version 2>/dev/null || echo "Docker CLI not available"         # check if Docker client is installed and version
docker ps 2>/dev/null || echo "No running containers"                   # list running containers if Docker is active
```

- **Docker service**: Not installed and inactive.
- **Docker client**: Not available.
- **Running containers**: None.

---

## 18. Security Frameworks & Hardening

```bash
aa-status 2>/dev/null || echo "AppArmor not configured"                 # check if AppArmor mandatory access control is active
sestatus 2>/dev/null || echo "SELinux not installed (normal on Ubuntu)" # check SELinux status (expected absent on Ubuntu)
systemctl is-active fail2ban 2>/dev/null || echo "fail2ban not installed"   # check if fail2ban intrusion-prevention service is running
fail2ban-client status 2>/dev/null | head -10                           # show fail2ban global status and active jails
```

- **AppArmor**: Kernel module is loaded but no active profiles are configured.
- **SELinux**: Not installed, which is expected for Ubuntu.
- **fail2ban**: Not installed and service inactive.

---

## 19. Backup & Recovery

```bash
which rsync tar gzip 2>/dev/null || true                                      # check presence of backup/archiving tools
grep -R --line-number -i backup /etc/cron* 2>/dev/null || echo "No backup cron jobs found"   # search system/user cron jobs for backup tasks
df -h | egrep '(/backup|/home|/var)'                                          # report disk usage and free space on common backup or data directories
```

- **Tools present**: `rsync`, `tar`, `gzip` available for file transfer and archiving.
- **Scheduled jobs**: No system or user backup crontabs found, except the built-in `dpkg-db-backup` job in `/etc/cron.daily/dpkg` for package database protection.
- **Disk usage**: Standard `/home` and `/var` partitions only; no dedicated `/backup` mount detected.

---

## 20. Time Synchronization

```bash
timedatectl status                                                                 # show system time, timezone, and sync state
systemctl is-active systemd-timesyncd 2>/dev/null || systemctl is-active chrony 2>/dev/null   # check if NTP service (timesyncd or chrony) is active
egrep '^(NTP=|FallbackNTP=)' /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf 2>/dev/null               # list configured NTP and fallback servers
```

- **System clock**: Correct UTC time (`Tue 2025-09-23 18:12:24 UTC`) but `System clock synchronized: no`.
- **NTP service**: Neither `systemd-timesyncd` nor `chrony` is active.
- **NTP configuration**: No active `NTP=` or `FallbackNTP=` entries shown in `/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf`.

---

## 21. Compliance & Critical Configurations

```bash
ls -la /etc/passwd /etc/shadow /etc/group                             # check permissions and ownership of core account and group files
egrep -v '^(#|$)' /etc/sudoers                                         # show active sudoers configuration lines (no comments/blank lines)
ls -la /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/crontab /etc/fstab 2>/dev/null        # verify permissions on critical configuration files
```

- **Core account files**:
    - `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` are world-readable (`644`), normal for Ubuntu.
    - `/etc/shadow` is `640 root:shadow`, protecting password hashes.
- **Sudo policy**: Active lines allow full root privileges for `root`, the `admin` group, and `sudo` group. The `@includedir /etc/sudoers.d` line allows drop-in rules but none unexpected are listed.
- **Key configs**: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, `/etc/crontab`, and `/etc/fstab` are all owned by root and set `644`, which is standard for these files.

## **22. Risk Assessment & Remediation**

|Finding|Likelihood|Impact|Priority|Evidence|Remediation|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|No System Clock Sync|M|M|P1|`timedatectl` shows "System clock synchronized: no"|`sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-timesyncd`|
|Firewall Inactive|L|M|P2|`ufw status` shows "inactive" for lab environment|Enable basic UFW: `sudo ufw enable && sudo ufw allow ssh` (optional for homelab)|
|No Backup Strategy|L|L|P3|No scheduled backups found|VM snapshots via VirtualBox are sufficient for homelab|

## **23. Detection & SOC Integration**

**SIEM Learning Priorities:**

- **Wazuh Service Health**: Basic monitoring that services stay running
- **Log Ingestion**: Verify agents from DC01, APP01, WIN11-MGR1 are connecting
- **Dashboard Access**: Confirm Kibana interface remains accessible for analysis
- **Storage Management**: Monitor disk usage doesn't fill up VM

**Lab-Appropriate Monitoring:**

- Simple service status checks: `systemctl status wazuh-*`
- Agent connectivity via Wazuh dashboard
- Basic log flow verification from Windows endpoints
- VM resource monitoring (memory/disk) through VirtualBox

## 24. Compliance Impact

### **SOC 2 Control Failures:**

**CC7.1 (System Monitoring) - MODERATE FAILURE:**

- SIEM infrastructure lacks comprehensive monitoring of its own security posture
- No file integrity monitoring (AIDE) creates blind spot for unauthorized configuration changes
- Evidence: `systemctl is-active auditd` shows "inactive", `which aide` returns "not installed"

**CC6.1 (Logical Access Controls) - MINOR FAILURE:**

- SIEM administrative access not restricted by network-level controls
- Time synchronization issues could impact log correlation and forensic timeline accuracy
- Evidence: UFW firewall inactive, `timedatectl status` shows unsynchronized clock

**CC8.1 (Vulnerability Management) - MINOR FAILURE:**

- Development tools present on security infrastructure increase attack surface
- No systematic integrity verification of installed packages
- Evidence: `which gcc g++ make` confirms compilers on production SIEM

### **Recommended Control Implementation:**

**Immediate (30 days):**

- Enable NTP synchronization to ensure accurate log timestamps for incident correlation (CC7.1)
- Implement file integrity monitoring baseline for critical SIEM configuration files (CC7.1)
- Document SIEM administrative access procedures and network restrictions (CC6.1)

**Short-term (90 days):**

- Remove unnecessary development tools to reduce attack surface (CC8.1)
- Establish automated backup procedures for SIEM configuration and indices (CC7.2)
- Deploy network-level access controls restricting SIEM management interfaces (CC6.1)

**Long-term (6 months):**

- Implement comprehensive SIEM-on-SIEM monitoring with dedicated monitoring dashboard (CC7.1)
- Develop incident response procedures specific to SIEM infrastructure compromise (CC7.3)

**Verification Commands:**

```powershell
# Verify time synchronization remediation
timedatectl status | grep "System clock synchronized"
systemctl is-active systemd-timesyncd

# Confirm firewall configuration
sudo ufw status verbose

# Validate file integrity monitoring
sudo aide --check 2>/dev/null || echo "AIDE baseline needed"

# Verify Wazuh service health
systemctl status wazuh-manager wazuh-indexer wazuh-dashboard --no-pager

# Check agent connectivity
sudo /var/ossec/bin/agent_control -l

# Validate log ingestion
curl -s "localhost:9200/_cluster/health" | python3 -m json.tool

# Confirm development tools removal
which gcc g++ make || echo "Development tools successfully removed"

# Verify backup strategy implementation
ls -la /backup/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Backup directory not configured"
```

**Post-Assessment Actions:**

1. Schedule monthly security baseline review using these verification commands
2. Update risk assessment based on remediation progress
3. Document any deviations from standard configuration in change management log
4. Prepare evidence package for SOC 2 auditor review of SIEM security controls

**Evidence Retention:**

- Assessment scripts and results: 3 years (compliance requirement)
- Configuration baselines: Until next major version upgrade
- Security incident logs: 7 years (regulatory requirement)
